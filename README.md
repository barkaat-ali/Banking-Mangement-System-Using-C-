<h1><b>Bank Account Management System Using C++</b></h1>
<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
The provided code is a program for managing bank account records. It allows users to perform various operations such as entering new records, searching and displaying existing records, deleting records, changing records, viewing the customer list, balance inquiry, depositing and withdrawing amounts, and transferring amounts between accounts.
<h2><b>Breakdown of the Code:</b></h2>
<b>Header Files:</b> The necessary header files are included in the code, such as <code><iostream></code>, <code><fstream></code>, <code><iomanip></code>, and <code><string></code>.

<b>Constant:</b> The code defines a constant <code>SIZE</code> with a value of 100, which is used as the size for character arrays.

<b>Account Structure:</b> The code defines a structure named <code>Account</code> which represents a bank account. It contains various member variables such as <code>accountNO</code>, <code>name</code>, <code>city</code>, <code>state</code>, <code>zip</code>, <code>telephoneNo</code>, <code>accountBalance</code>, <code>day</code>, <code>month</code>, and <code>year</code>.

<b>Function Prototypes:</b> The code declares prototypes for several functions that will be defined later. These functions include <code>Enter_record</code>, <code>SearchAndDisplay_record</code>, <code>SearchAndDelete_record</code>, <code>SearchAndChange_record</code>, <code>ViewCustomerList</code>, <code>BalanceInquiry</code>, <code>DepositAmmount</code>, <code>WithdrawAmount</code>, and <code>TransferAmount</code>.

<b>Main Function:</b> The main function is the entry point of the program. It displays a menu to the user and allows them to choose different options based on their requirements. The main loop continues until the user selects the option to exit the system.

<b>Menu Options:</b> The menu options are displayed using <code>cout</code> statements. The user is prompted to enter a numeric option corresponding to the desired operation.

<b>User Input and Option Handling:</b> The code reads the user's option using <code>cin</code> and performs input validation to ensure a valid option is entered. If an invalid option is entered, the user is prompted to enter again.

<b>Switch Statement:</b> Based on the user's option, the code executes different cases using a switch statement. Each case corresponds to a specific operation and calls the corresponding function to perform that operation.

<b>Function Implementations:</b> After the main function, the code defines the functions that were declared earlier. These functions implement the functionality for entering records, searching and displaying records, deleting records, changing records, viewing the customer list, balance inquiry, depositing and withdrawing amounts, and transferring amounts.

<b>File Handling:</b> The functions use file handling operations to read from and write to a binary file named <code>"dafile.dat"</code> which stores the bank account records. The file is opened using <code>fstream</code> in various modes such as <code>ios::out</code>, <code>ios::in</code>, <code>ios::binary</code>, <code>ios::app</code>, and <code>ios::beg</code> depending on the operation being performed.

<b>Record Manipulation:</b> The functions manipulate the records by reading data from the file into the <code>Account</code> structure, modifying the structure's members based on user input, and writing the updated structure back to the file.

<b>Output and User Interaction:</b> The functions provide appropriate output messages and interact with the user using <code>cout</code> and <code>cin</code>. They display information such as account details, balance, customer list, and handle user input for various operations.

Overall, the code provides a menu-driven interface for managing bank account records, allowing users to perform a variety of operations on the records stored in a binary file.
